# Phase 4 Progress Report

## Status: In Progress

### Completed Components

#### PCI Device Passthrough Foundation
✅ **PCI Device Types** (`pkg/esxi/pci/types.go`)
- Device structure with full PCI information
- GPU-specific device type with profiles
- Passthrough configuration
- Helper methods for device classification

✅ **PCI Discovery** (`pkg/esxi/pci/discovery.go`)
- List all PCI devices on host
- GPU-specific discovery with memory detection
- Assignable device filtering
- Enable/disable passthrough capability
- Device validation for VM assignment

✅ **Known GPU Database**
- NVIDIA Tesla series (P40, V100, A100, H100)
- AMD Radeon Pro series
- Intel Iris Xe
- Automatic GPU type detection

### In Progress

#### PCI Passthrough CLI Commands
- [ ] `ceso pci list` - List all PCI devices
- [ ] `ceso pci list --gpus` - List GPU devices only
- [ ] `ceso pci info <device>` - Device details
- [ ] `ceso pci enable <device>` - Enable passthrough
- [ ] `ceso vm attach-pci` - Attach device to VM

### Remaining Phase 4 Tasks

1. **PCI Passthrough** (40% complete)
   - ✅ Device discovery and types
   - ✅ GPU detection and profiles
   - ⏳ CLI commands
   - [ ] VM attachment operations
   - [ ] vGPU profile management

2. **vCenter Integration** (0% complete)
   - [ ] vCenter client implementation
   - [ ] Resource pool management
   - [ ] DRS integration
   - [ ] Migration support

3. **Hot Backup** (0% complete)

   - [ ] Application consistency

4. **Multi-ESXi Host** (0% complete)
   - [ ] Multi-host configuration
   - [ ] Host discovery and management
   - [ ] Cross-host operations
   - [ ] Load balancing

5. **Advanced Networking** (0% complete)

   - [ ] Distributed switch support
   - [ ] Network policies

6. **Resource Optimization** (0% complete)
   - [ ] Placement engine
   - [ ] Resource monitoring
   - [ ] Optimization recommendations

## Architecture Decisions

### PCI Passthrough Design
- Using govmomi native PCI passthrough APIs
- Separate discovery from assignment operations
- GPU-aware with vendor-specific optimizations
- Extensible device type system

### GPU Support Strategy
- Priority on NVIDIA Tesla/Data Center GPUs
- vGPU profile support for multi-tenancy
- Future support for consumer GPUs
- Validation before assignment to prevent conflicts

## Next Steps

1. Complete PCI CLI commands
2. Implement VM device attachment
3. Add integration tests for PCI operations
4. Begin vCenter integration layer
5. Document GPU passthrough procedures

## Technical Challenges

1. **PCI Device Management**: Complex govmomi API requires careful error handling
2. **GPU Memory Detection**: Currently using static lookup, needs dynamic query
3. **vGPU Profiles**: Profile discovery requires host-specific queries
4. **IOMMU Groups**: Need to handle device group dependencies

## Risk Mitigation

- Extensive validation before device assignment
- Rollback capability for failed operations
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting
- Compatibility matrix for known devices
