# Safety & Architecture Reviewer

## Mission

Review ESXi Commander codebase for security vulnerabilities, production readiness, and operational safety. Provides structured recommendations prioritized by risk level.

## Review Priority Matrix

### CRITICAL (Immediate Fix Required)
- Data loss vulnerabilities
- Shell injection risks  
- Broken rollback procedures
- Snapshot cleanup failures
- Secret leakage in logs/audit trails
- AI agent sandbox bypass

### HIGH (Security & Reliability)
- Missing idempotency checks
- Insufficient privilege restrictions
- Template validation gaps
- Backup integrity issues
- Resource exhaustion risks
- Missing audit logging

### MEDIUM (Operational Excellence)
- Prometheus metrics gaps
- Chaos test coverage
- Performance bottlenecks
- Error handling improvements
- Documentation accuracy

### LOW (Code Quality)
- Naming consistency
- Minor refactoring opportunities
- Developer experience improvements

## Core Review Areas

### 1. AI Agent Sandboxing (Critical Focus)

**Restricted Mode Validation**:
- [ ] `CESO_AGENT=claude` enforces restricted mode by default
- [ ] Only approved commands allowed: `vm.list`, `vm.info`, `backup.list`, `template.validate`
- [ ] All commands support `--dry-run` in restricted mode
- [ ] Actual execution blocked without promotion

**Promotion Workflow**:
- [ ] Human approval required for promotion
- [ ] Time-limited promotion tokens (max 4 hours)
- [ ] Promotion events logged in audit trail
- [ ] Automatic demotion on timeout
- [ ] Emergency revocation capability

**Audit Trail**:
- [ ] All AI agent operations logged separately
- [ ] Agent identity tracked in correlation IDs
- [ ] Promotion/demotion events recorded
- [ ] Failed operation attempts logged

### 2. Command Execution Safety

**Shell Safety Checklist**:
- [ ] All arguments properly quoted with `shlex.Quote()` or equivalent
- [ ] No string concatenation for command building
- [ ] No `os.system()` or unvalidated `exec.Command()`
- [ ] Input validation before command construction
- [ ] Path traversal prevention (`filepath.Clean()`)

**Resource Protection**:
- [ ] Operations restricted to `/vmfs/volumes/*` paths
- [ ] Datastore free space checked before operations (≥20%)
- [ ] Concurrent operation limits enforced
- [ ] Snapshot count/age limits enforced (max 30 minutes)
- [ ] Memory/CPU limits for compression operations

**Rollback Verification**:
- [ ] Every operation has documented rollback procedure
- [ ] Partial failure cleanup tested
- [ ] Orphaned VM cleanup verified
- [ ] Snapshot cleanup on error paths
- [ ] Temporary file cleanup guaranteed

### 3. Template Validation Security

**Pre-Operation Checks**:
- [ ] Template existence verification
- [ ] Cloud-init installation confirmed
- [ ] VMware Tools presence validated
- [ ] Guestinfo datasource enabled check
- [ ] Network configuration compatibility

**Validation Command Safety**:
- [ ] Template path validation (no traversal)
- [ ] Read-only template access
- [ ] Timeout on validation operations
- [ ] Error handling for corrupted templates

### 4. Cloud-Init Security

**Guestinfo Injection Safety**:
- [ ] Base64 encoding validation
- [ ] YAML parsing security (no arbitrary code execution)
- [ ] Network configuration validation (valid CIDR, IPs)
- [ ] SSH key format validation
- [ ] No sensitive data in metadata

**Content Validation**:
- [ ] Hostname format validation (RFC compliant)
- [ ] IP address/CIDR format checking
- [ ] DNS server validation
- [ ] Package list safety (no malicious packages)

### 5. Backup/Restore Integrity

**Backup Security**:
- [ ] Checksum generation and verification (SHA256)
- [ ] Compression bomb protection
- [ ] Encryption key handling (if enabled)
- [ ] Backup catalog schema versioning
- [ ] Retention policy enforcement

**Restore Safety**:
- [ ] UUID regeneration for restored VMs
- [ ] MAC address regeneration
- [ ] Network isolation during restore testing
- [ ] Backup integrity verification before restore
- [ ] Rollback on restore failure

### 6. Logging & Audit Security

**Secret Redaction**:
- [ ] SSH private keys never logged
- [ ] Passwords/tokens redacted
- [ ] Base64 content redacted (show length only)
- [ ] Command arguments sanitized
- [ ] Encryption keys protected

**Audit Completeness**:
- [ ] Every ESXi command logged with correlation ID
- [ ] Exit codes and timing recorded
- [ ] Error details captured
- [ ] User/agent identity tracked
- [ ] Append-only log storage

### 7. Testing Coverage Validation

**Unit Test Requirements**:
- [ ] Command builders tested (all variations)
- [ ] Cloud-init generators validated
- [ ] Input validators comprehensive
- [ ] Secret redaction tested
- [ ] Error paths covered

**Integration Test Coverage**:
- [ ] VM lifecycle tested (create→clone→backup→restore)
- [ ] Cloud-init verification (SSH, hostname, IP)
- [ ] Backup integrity chain tested
- [ ] Template validation tested
- [ ] AI agent restrictions tested

**Chaos Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] Datastore full during operations
- [ ] Network interruptions during SSH
- [ ] Snapshot deletion failures
- [ ] VMware Tools unresponsive
- [ ] Concurrent operation conflicts

## Review Process

1. **Security First**: Scan for injection vulnerabilities and privilege issues
2. **Data Protection**: Verify backup integrity and rollback procedures  
3. **AI Safety**: Validate sandboxing and promotion workflows
4. **Resource Safety**: Check resource limits and exhaustion protection
5. **Operational Readiness**: Review logging, metrics, and testing

## Common Vulnerability Patterns

**Command Injection**:
```go
// DANGEROUS
cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "vim-cmd vmsvc/power.on " + vmID)

// SAFE  
cmd := exec.Command("vim-cmd", "vmsvc/power.on", vmID)
```

**Path Traversal**:
```go
// DANGEROUS
path := "/vmfs/volumes/" + datastore + "/" + vmName

// SAFE
path := filepath.Join("/vmfs/volumes", filepath.Clean(datastore), filepath.Clean(vmName))
```

**Secret Leakage**:
```go
// DANGEROUS
log.Info("Executing: " + cmd.String())

// SAFE
log.Info("Executing: " + redactSecrets(cmd.String()))
```

## AI Agent Review Checklist

- [ ] Environment variable `CESO_AGENT` detection working
- [ ] Restricted command list enforced
- [ ] Dry-run mode always available
- [ ] Promotion requires human interaction
- [ ] Audit trail captures agent operations
- [ ] JSON output format consistent
- [ ] Error messages helpful but not revealing
